        <h2 id="first-sect">Here you're gonna learn how to approach women properly.</h2>

        <p id="first-sect"> <span id="principal-p">The</span> main question that may come into your mind is this: How can I do that? Well it is very easy but not that easy in the beguining 'cause in the beguining your mind doesn't know anything about that, about approaching women it's a completely and relatively new. That's why your mind it is going to think that you're in danger and it will advise you to not going for it 'cause it may hurt you that's is what your mind going think 'cause it is trying to protect you.
        </p>
        <p id="first-sect">
            women are kind of easy, the only thing that you need to do is just knowing what you're doing, so here we're gonna teach you what to do and what to not do, then let's dive in what you're not suppose do.
        </p>
        <h2 id="first-sect"> approaching women on the street </h2>
        <p id="first-sect"> 
            well whenever you approach women on the street, let's suppose that you're walking on the same direction. Never approach her from behind that's not ideal and it shows your lack of confidence and women appreciate confident man, something else that you need to consider, never approach the girl already touching her, like touching on her shoulder or even grabbing her arm, that's gonna send bad impresion of you into her mind. 
        </p>
        <div class="first-div" id="first-div">
            <div class="first-div1" id="first-div1">
                <p id="first-sect">
                    This is how you're suppose to do the things, whenever you approach a woman, let's go to that example that I gave minutes ago of both of you walking at the same direction, then what are you going to do? 
                </p>
                <p id="first-sect">
                    You need to run a bit towords her and get two setps ahead, then you gonna look at her while in the same time you stretch your hand to shake  her hand and say whatever you wanna say. So this is the right way to approach a woman when you guys are walking at the same direction. 
                </p>
                <p id="first-sect">
                    Case you guys are walking in diferent directions like you're walking in such direction and she's walking in opposite direction of you that means that  you guys are gonna pass each other. This is how you're going to approach: you will have to look at her first for a such distance so that she can notice that this guy is looking at me, and after that you will smile and from two meters of distance you will say "Hi" to her while keeping the smile, that's gonna let her comfortable and she's gonna even think that you know her, and that is gonna let her a little bit more open to talk to you. So this is basically how you're gonna approach women on the street, below we gonna focus on other places approach structure.

        <h2 class="h2-second" id="first-sect" >Approaching Women in the Club and Bars</h2>
        <p id="first-sect">
            These kind of areas are little bit diferent from streets approaches the approaches in these areas are generally called by warm approach but the usually name is night game, so here we're going to learn some tips so that we can most of the times get success in the clubs and bars. There is something that we need to agree, clubs and bars are the most common places people think that is more appropriate to get to know women, but in reality that's not true. You may be confused 'cause what I'm saying, but here I'm gonna explain you why that, just look at this. In clubs and bars there a lot of people with the same purpose then that's gonna  make a little bit difficult your performace int these places 'cause there will be people who are better looking than you, I'm not saying that it's all about good looking but we have to confess that looks do matter and there will be people taller than you, there will be people richer than you, that is, there will be a lot of competition and all the men will focus on that beautiful woman ever, so for you to get that beautiful one you will have to be good. That's why I recommend for those who are beginners to focus on street approaches first where there isn't a lot of competition and most of the women are not expect a man to approach her.

                    Approach women at the bars it is a little bit easy when you know what you're doing. So the first thing that you need to do is present the best version of your self, basically I'm saying that you need to wear good clothes and take care of your physical appearance 'cause as we said in these areas there is a lot of competition so you need to be in your best version. 
                </p>
                <p id="first-sect">
                    Well approach women at the bars has some rules, one of the things that you can't do is approaching the woman from behind or even touch her shoulder while she didn't see you yet, another thing I don't recommend you to approach her already offering a beer 'cause is what every man does. And you have to be diferent as you said on the previous texts. 
                </p>
                <p id="first-sect">
                    The right way to approach a woman at the bar is similar to the ways of approaching women on the streets, here you need to observe her and pickup the maxim information that you can and after that you're gonna go to talk her using all the information that you collected, basically I'm saying that you can't get there and straight way say that is very beautiful that's not gonna work. So you will go there in front of her while she's looking at you and you gonna say for example "Do you noticed that you're the only woman  who has green dress?" saying that you gonna differentiate your self from all other men.  
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="first-p" id="first-sect">
            You need to understand that beautiful women are constanly being conquered by men but most of them don't even know what they are doing, and biologically women crave for  confident man and confident man means somebody who knows what's doing, then if you approach her making strong eye contact with a masculine deep voice with strong body language and using situational approaching you pretty much done most of the hard  work. Well this how you gonna approach women at the bars, follow these steps and get sucess after sucess.

        <h2 id="first-sect">How to Approach Women in the Clubs</h2>
        <p id="first-sect">
            Approach in the clubs is similar to approach women anywhere but the difference between streets, bars ande other places from clubs is: Clubs has crowd of people in the same space, is too noisy and people are dancing everywhere and this makes it difficult to start a conversion with that woman that you're real into 'cause the music is too high, people are moving madly and it disturbs. 
        </p>
        <p id="first-sect">
            Well here I'm gonna share with you what you have to do to get sucess in night clubs, you need to identify your target and as at bars that you needed to use all the information you collected during the chat here isn't going to be different, look at her first and collect whatever you can collect 'cause you will need that in the future.
        </p>
        <div class="third-div"  id="final-pic">
            <div class="third-div1"></div>
            <div class="third-div2"></div>
        </div>
        <p class="last-p" id="first-sect">
            Well you have already collected all the possible information now you will go to her while making eye contact and very close to her ear you will say something, you may be confused like why am I suppose to get so close? This is because clubs are very noisy then if do not get close she's more luckly to not hear what you're gonna say and don't be afraid she's going to understand that and in the same time she wants to be approached, ideal you need to let her see you first before you come close to launch the opener 'cause that isn't gonna scare her, but if you are behind her and she doesn't turn to see who's behind her so that you can launch your opener, my advice is dance a little bit behind her but don't touch her butt just dance and make some noise just to get her attention, that is, to make her turn and look for this guy who has high energy, and then you ready to launch your opener.
