        <h1>how to run the conversation properly</h1>
        <p>
            Many men struggle with what to say during the approach and I have to confess is somthing normal. Why does this happen? It basically because you're so nervous and you start to think so many steps ahead 'cause you realy want it to work, instead of focus on the moment you think just like <span>Oh I'm gonna "Hi" say and after that I'm gonna ask how her day is going and bla bla bla bla.</span> You need to understand that this is not right, when you try to anticipate the conversation most of the time it isn't going the way you think  it is 'cause you must realise that the feedbacks that you gave to your self while you were anticipating the conversation might not be the same feedbacks that you gonna get from her that's why the importance of being in the moment.
        </p>
        <h2>Be aware of the conversation</h2>
        <p>
            This is the first tip to have those successful and excited chats with women be in the moment, so what does it meanig?  Be in the moment is to pay attention on the person and what the person is saying, basically you will be there looking at her facial signals and comment on that and those signals are the things that gonna drive your interactions and is the best way of drive an interaction. So be in the moment is basically pay attention on what the person is saying and her body language, that's what gonna make you a good talker.
        </p>

        <p>
            Be in the moment it also gives you so many benefits 'cause you will be aware of everything that is happaning there, for example you will be able to know if she's interested or not and that is gonna save you time 'cause women generally doesn't have the courage to say <span>Hey get fuck out, I don't wanna talk to you.</span> so they will bring signals so that you can see that she's not interested. 
        </p>
       <h2>The last word she said</h2>
       <p>
            Men generally struggle with conversation 'cause maybe they don't know what to say or even  they're afraid of runnig out things to say but as we saw above, to start a conversation is easy, just be in the moment, that's gonna help you a lot because being in the moment  will allow you to start a conversation about what is happaning there or even about something you saw on her. So to never running out things to say and in the same time not lose that girl you have to focus a little bit on the last word that she said and use that word to build another conversation, it's basically like this she says for example <span>I like to watch Marvel when I'm free</span> and you can say <span>Ohhh what kind of Marvel drawings do you like to watch when you free?</span>, so is basically this kind of thing that you gotta do, to never run out things to say, allways focus on the last word or even the three last words that she said.

                <h2 class="h2">Online conversation</h2>
                <p class="h2">
                    Online conversation is kind similar to real life chat the only difference is that you just can't apply that concept of be in the moment 'cause you can't see the person unless you guys are using vidio call or something similar to that but here we're talking about online conversation through mensage.
                </p>
                <p class="h2">
                    Well here to start a conversation you have to be different from other men, most men text badly they usually send these kind of mesange: <span>Hey How are you or just hello or even Hi what's good</span> and that is the wrong way to start the conversation in online dating. So what do you have to do?

                </p>
                <p class="h2" >
                    Well you have to look at her profile photo, her bio or even her status if you have acess to it, and from that you're going to comment what you found interesting on her profile or even her status and you're going use that as reason to start a conversation.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Let's suppose that she wrote this excerpt: <span>I like pets</span> on her bio, seeing that you can say <span>Ohh I guess you like chickens kkkkk</span> with some laughs 'cause you're teasing her when you say she likes chickens 'cause maybe is not what she wanted to say. So this how you're going to start your conversation on online platforms. 
        </p>
        <p id="last-p">
            The <span>Last word concept</span> is applicable in this situation too, where you will allways look for the last word she said to continue the conversation or even to change the topic of conversation, so can you can base on the examples that we gave above to structure your chats and this concept is very powerful when is used in the right way because you will never run out things to say.
