             number</h3>

        <p>
            You might be confused like is there a right way to ask for her number? And I have to confess is not exactly a right way becuase you can ask a girl's number in anyway you feel like but we want to show you a certain way that is going to reduce rejection, and this is basically bring a reason why to take her number.
        </p>
        <p>
            Well instead of just say <span>can you give me your number?</span> You have to bring a reason why you want her number, becuase doing that she's more luckly to give it to you becuase you have already explicited what you guys are going to do or what you're gonna do with her number. Because most  women are afraid of being controlled then if you don't explicit what are you guys going to do or even  what you're gonna do with her number, she may think that you're gonna clog her with messages every time or even calling every time and  taking out her peace. So you must bring a reason to take her number and I advice you  not asking for permition just say <span>Let me with your number so that we can go and do bla bla bla bla</span> 'cause when you ask for permition it just transmit weakness, that is, she will see you as a weak man.

                <h2 id="h2-s">Some examples so that you can base on.</h2>
                <p>
                    You can use this line: <span>It was good to talk to you and I would like to continue this conversation another time, let me with your number and I'm gonna text you.</span> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also say this one: <span>The reason why I stopped you here is 'cause I found you attractive and I wanna take you on date, then let me with your number so that I can let you know when.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are so many other examples, but what I want  you to know is that you have to bring the proposal first not becuase asking for the nummber first and after that bring the proposal is wrong. But bring the proposal first it is more appropriated and it difference you from other man, that is, you become special in her mind.
